         <h1>Violent Crimes</h1>
         <p>This page explores violent crimes specifically across the United States, focusing on how different types, such as murder, robbery, and aggravated assault, are distributed across states. By visualizing both raw counts and population-adjusted rates, this page aims to reveal which states experience higher levels of violent crime and which types are most prevalent. </p>

          </div>
         <p>This bar chart shows the total number of reported violent crimes in each U.S. state in 2016, broken down by crime type: murder/manslaughter, robbery, and aggravated assault. Aggravated assault stands out as the most common violent offense in nearly every state, often by a large margin. Robbery is generally the second most frequent, while murder and manslaughter have the lowest counts overall. States like California, Texas, and New York report especially high numbers, reflecting their larger populations.</p>

         <p>This stacked bar chart shows the relative proportions of each violent crime type—murder/manslaughter, robbery, and aggravated assault—within each U.S. state in 2016. Unlike the previous graph, which displayed total counts, this chart focuses on percentages to highlight how each crime type contributes to the overall violent crime profile of a state. Across nearly all states, aggravated assault makes up the largest share of violent crimes, often over 60-70%. Robbery follows as the second most common, with murder and manslaughter consistently comprising only a small fraction. In some states, however, like Idaho and Wyoming, aggravated assault makes up approximately 90% of the violent crimes committed.</p>

         <p>This pie chart visualizes the overall breakdown of violent crimes in the United States in 2016. It clearly shows that aggravated assault dominates, accounting for nearly 70% of all violent crime incidents. Robbery makes up just under 30%, while murder and manslaughter constitute a very small fraction—only about 1.5%. This distribution reinforces the insight from earlier charts: while homicide often receives the most attention, the vast majority of violent crime is driven by less fatal but still serious offenses, particularly aggravated assault.</p>

         <h2 id="choropleth">Violent Crime Rate Over Time by State (Animated Choropleth)</h2>
    <iframe src="visualization3_choropleth.html" width="1000" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
<p>The animated choropleth highlights distinct regional patterns in violent crime rates across U.S. states from 2001 to 2016. States in the South and Southwest generally displayed higher violent crime rates compared to those in the Northeast and Midwest, which remained relatively lower throughout the years. While many states showed a gradual decrease in violent crime rates, some states experienced irregular fluctuations, suggesting local factors or specific events may have influenced crime levels. Overall, the animation emphasizes the uneven progress in violent crime reduction across different regions of the country.

    <h2 id="line">Violent Crime Over Time by State (Line Chart)</h2>
    
    <iframe src="visualization4_linechart.html" width="1000" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
         <p>The visualization shows a general decline in violent crime totals across most U.S. states from 2001 to 2016, indicating a nationwide trend of decreasing violent crime during this period. However, some states, such as Texas and Pennsylvania, show relatively stable or fluctuating trends, suggesting regional differences in crime reduction efforts or societal factors. Notably, California (the top cyan line) remains consistently the highest contributor to violent crime totals due to its large population, though it still experienced a meaningful decline throughout the years.</p>
